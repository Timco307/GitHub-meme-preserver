How to preserve a meme
Please read this whole README file before you add anything and I will ask you if you did before I allow you to add anything

Please check that the repository does not have the meme that you're trying to add always check that please and thank you!!!

1. Make a folder and for the name put in the artists name that made the meme so their username and then put @ then there platform thing like Discord would be DC, Facebook would be FB, YouTube would be YT, Twitter/X would be TW, and Github would be GH and for other media you need to put in the full url! If you know the real name put a slash and then the real name example ( timmy394@DC\Timmy turner ) make sure that the slash is a forward slash or else gethub will think that you're trying to make a folder which you are trying but it's going to make two folders and some other stuff which is weird! If The person has more than one media then this is how you would put it in as a folder example ( timmy394@DC-timmythereal@FB\Timmy Turner ) and if there is more than two then you'll just add another dash and that's it!

2. Then inside that artist folder you need to make a year folder and make sure that you actually put the year that the meme was created or the song or the video was created and not when it got popular and if there's already like a 2024 folder don't make a new one!

3. Then after you find the year then go onto that folder and add your meme PNG,JPEG video file or whatever

4. Rename the file of the meme name accordingly you need to rename the meme as the actual meme if the meme has a name rename the PNG or video file to that but remember do not delete the file extension but if the meme does not have a name then you can name it your self appropriate to the meme!

5. How to see the date the video was uploaded on YouTube use this url [https://ytlarge.com/youtube/video-data-viewer] and if you want to download a mp3,mp4,wav and some more go to this url [https://tuberipper.com/23/save/mp4]

If you do not know the artist or the date
If you have tried very hard to find the artist or the date and you can't find either one of those there will be an unknown artist folder and inside of every artist folder there will be an unknown date folder too but if you don't know the artist just go to the unknown artist folder and also inside the unknown artist folder there's also gonna be an unknown date just in case I'm telling you this if you didn't know that!

If you have a big video file go to your desktop and download GitHub desktop then make a fork of our preserver and put in all of the things above then put in your video file or whatever and then upload it to your fork then go to the website and then Commit a change to our main gethub meme preserver!
