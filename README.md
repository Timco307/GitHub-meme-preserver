How to preserve a meme
Please read this whole README file before you add anything and I will ask you if you did before I allow you to add anything

Please check that the repository does not have the meme that you're trying to add always check that please and thank you!!!

1. Make a foler for the name put in the year that the meme was created not when is popular! if there's already a year that you are going to make like 2019 and it's already there do not make a new one!!!

2. Go into your folder then make a second folder and for the name put in the artists name that made the meme so their username and then put @ then there platform thing like discord would be DN Facebook would be FB YouTube would be YT and Twitter would be TW or X and you cN do the same for other media too! If you know the real name put a slash and then the real name example ( timmy394@DN\Timmy turner ) make sure that the slash is a forward slash or else gethub will think that you're trying to make a folder which you are trying but it's going to make two folders and some other stuff which is weird!

3. Then after you find the person then go onto that folder and add your meme PNG,JPEG video file or whatever

4. Rename the file of the meme name accordingly you need to rename the meme as the actual meme if the meme has a name rename the PNG or video file to that but remember do not delete the file extension but if the meme does not have a name then you can name it your self appropriate to the meme!

If you do not know the artist or the date
If you have tried very hard to try and find the artist or the date that the meme was made there are already folders that say like unknown date and unknown artist and if you're making a folder a brand new date folder I mean year put an unknown artist folder inside there too please. So if you don't know the date or the artist just go onto one of the folders and put in the meme. So if you don't know the date the very first or bottom folder there will say the unknown date if you know the artist then in the unknown date do the same thing in step to that is above if you don't know the artist but you don't but you know the date go to the year and go to the unknown artist in the date!

If you have a big video file go to your desktop and download GitHub desktop then make a fork of our preserver and put in all of the things above then put in your video file or whatever and then upload it to your fork then go to the website and then Commit a change to our main gethub meme preserver!
