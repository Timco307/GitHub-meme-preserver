How to preserve a meme
1. Make a foler for the name put in the year that the meme was created not when is popular! if there's already a year that you are going to make like 2019 and it's already there do not make a new one!!!
2. go into your folder then make a second folder and for the name put in the artists name that made the meme so their username and then put a platform thing like discord would be DN Facebook would be FB YouTube would be YT and if you know the real name put a slash and then the real name example ( timmy394@DN/Timmy turner )
3. Then after you find the person then go onto that folder and add your meme PNG,JPEG video file or whatever

If you have a big video file go to your desktop and download GitHub desktop then make a fork of our preserver and put in all of the things above then put in your video file or whatever and then upload it to your fork then go to the website and then Commit a change to our main gethub meme preserver!
